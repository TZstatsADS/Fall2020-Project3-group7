In your final repo, there should be an R markdown file that organizes **all computational steps** for evaluating your proposed Facial Expression Recognition framework. 

This file is currently a template for running evaluation experiments. You should update it according to your codes but following precisely the same structure. 

```{r message=FALSE}
if(!require("EBImage")){
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}

if(!require("R.matlab")){
  install.packages("R.matlab")
}
if(!require("readxl")){
  install.packages("readxl")
}

if(!require("dplyr")){
  install.packages("dplyr")
}
if(!require("readxl")){
  install.packages("readxl")
}

if(!require("ggplot2")){
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}

if(!require("caret")){
  install.packages("caret")
}

if(!require("glmnet")){
  install.packages("glmnet")
}

if(!require("WeightedROC")){
  install.packages("WeightedROC")
}

library(R.matlab)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(BiocManager)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(glmnet)
library(WeightedROC)
library(OpenImageR)
```

### Step 0 set work directories
```{r wkdir, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(2020)
setwd("C:/Users/60171/Desktop/project3_gbm/doc")
```

Provide directories for training images. Training images and Training fiducial points will be in different subfolders. 
```{r}

train_dir <- "C:/Users/60171/Desktop/train_set/" # This will be modified for different data sets.
train_image_dir <- paste(train_dir, "images/", sep="")
train_pt_dir <- paste(train_dir,  "points/", sep="")
train_label_path <- paste(train_dir, "label.csv", sep="") 
```

### Step 1: set up controls for evaluation experiments.

In this chunk, we have a set of controls for the evaluation experiments. 

+ (T/F) cross-validation on the training set
+ (T/F) reweighting the samples for training set 
+ (number) K, the number of CV folds
+ (T/F) process features for training set
+ (T/F) run evaluation on an independent test set
+ (T/F) process features for test set

```{r exp_setup}
run.cv <- F # run cross-validation on the training set
sample.reweight <- TRUE # run sample reweighting in model training
K <- 5  # number of CV folds
run.feature.train <- TRUE # process features for training set
run.test <- TRUE # run evaluation on an independent test set
run.feature.test <- TRUE # process features for test set
```


### Step 2: import data and train-test split 
```{r}
#train-test split
info <- read.csv(train_label_path)
n <- nrow(info)
n_train <- round(n*(4/5), 0)
train_idx <- sample(info$Index, n_train, replace = F)
test_idx <- setdiff(info$Index, train_idx)
```

If you choose to extract features from images, such as using Gabor filter, R memory will exhaust all images are read together. The solution is to repeat reading a smaller batch(e.g 100) and process them. 
```{r}
n_files <- length(list.files(train_image_dir))

image_list <- list()
for(i in 1:100){
   image_list[[i]] <- readImage(paste0(train_image_dir, sprintf("%04d", i), ".jpg"))
}
```

Fiducial points are stored in matlab format. In this step, we read them and store them in a list.
```{r read fiducial points}
#function to read fiducial points
#input: index
#output: matrix of fiducial points corresponding to the index
readMat.matrix <- function(index){
     return(round(readMat(paste0(train_pt_dir, sprintf("%04d", index), ".mat"))[[1]],0))
}

#load fiducial points
fiducial_pt_list <- lapply(1:n_files, readMat.matrix)
save(fiducial_pt_list, file="../output/fiducial_pt_list.RData")
```

### Step 3: construct features and responses

+ The follow plots show how pairwise distance between fiducial points can work as feature for facial emotion recognition.

  + In the first column, 78 fiducials points of each emotion are marked in order. 
  + In the second column distributions of vertical distance between right pupil(1) and  right brow peak(21) are shown in  histograms. For example, the distance of an angry face tends to be shorter than that of a surprised face.
  + The third column is the distributions of vertical distances between right mouth corner(50)
and the midpoint of the upper lip(52).  For example, the distance of an happy face tends to be shorter than that of a sad face.

`feature.R` should be the wrapper for all your feature engineering functions and options. The function `feature( )` should have options that correspond to different scenarios for your project and produces an R object that contains features and responses that are required by all the models you are going to evaluate later. 
  
  + `feature.R`
  + Input: list of images or fiducial point
  + Output: an RData file that contains extracted features and corresponding responses

```{r feature}
source("../lib/feature.R")
tm_feature_train <- NA
if(run.feature.train){
  tm_feature_train <- system.time(dat_train <- feature(fiducial_pt_list, train_idx))
  save(dat_train, file="../output/feature_train.RData")
}else{
  load(file="../output/feature_train.RData")
}

tm_feature_test <- NA
if(run.feature.test){
  tm_feature_test <- system.time(dat_test <- feature(fiducial_pt_list, test_idx))
  save(dat_test, file="../output/feature_test.RData")
}else{
  load(file="../output/feature_test.RData")
}
# transfer label column from factor to numeric
dat_train$label <- as.numeric(dat_train$label)-1
dat_test$label <- as.numeric(dat_test$label)-1
```

### Step 4: Train baseline model with training features and responses
Call the train model and test model from library. 

`train.R` and `test.R` should be wrappers for all your model training steps and your classification/prediction steps. 

+ `train.R`
  + Input: a data frame containing features and labels and a parameter list.
  + Output:a trained model
+ `test.R`
  + Input: the fitted classification model using training data and processed features from testing images 
  + Input: an R object that contains a trained classifier.
  + Output: training model specification

##### Step 4.1: Baseline Model - Gradient Boosting Machine(GBM) with default setting of parameters
###### Step 4.1(a): Train GBM with default setting of parameters
The defalut parameters are:

+ distribution = "bernoulli" (if the response has only 2 unique values, bernoulli is assumed)
+ n.trees = 100, 
+ shrinkage = 0.1, 
+ interaction.depth = 1,

```{r train_GBM_base}
# load model built-in from ib
source("../lib/train_GBM_base.R") 

# fit train data
tm_train_GBM_base = NA
tm_train_GBM_base <- system.time(fit_train_GBM_base <- train_GBM_base(features= dat_train))
save(fit_train_GBM_base , file="../output/train_GBM_base.RData")
```
The result of GBM with default setting of parameters

```{r}
fit_train_GBM_base
```
###### Step 4.1(b): Test GBM with default setting of parameters

Calculate the training error of default GBM model
```{r train_err_gbm}
### load models built
source("../lib/test_GBM_base.R")
pred_train_GBM_base <- round(test_GBM_base(fit_train_GBM_base, features = dat_train),digit=0)
accu_train_GBM_base <- mean(pred_train_GBM_base  == dat_train$label)
cat("The trainig accuracy of model: GBM", "is", accu_train_GBM_base *100, "%.\n")
```

Then, we predicted the test data and evaluated the performance of default GBM model.
```{r test_gbm}
### load models built
source("../lib/test_GBM_base.R")
### predict test data
tm_test_GBM_base=NA
if(run.test){
  load(file="../output/train_GBM_base.RData")
  tm_test_GBM_base <- system.time(pred <- test_GBM_base(fit_train_GBM_base, dat_test))
}
```

Evaluation on GBM model
```{r}
pred_test_GBM_base = round(test_GBM_base(fit_train_GBM_base, dat_test),digit=0)
accu_test_GBM_base <- mean(dat_test$label == pred_test_GBM_base)
cat("The accuracy of model: gradient boosting machine", "is", accu_test_GBM_base*100, "%.\n")
cat("Time for training model GBM_baseline = ", tm_train_GBM_base[1], "s \n")
cat("Time for testing model GBM_baseline = ",tm_test_GBM_base[1], "s \n")
```


### Step 5: Other advanced models

#### Step 5.1: SVM

#### Step 5.2: Random Forest

#### Step 5.3: CNN


### Summarize Running Time
Prediction performance matters, so does the running times for constructing features and for training the model, especially when the computation resource is limited. 
```{r running_time}

```
